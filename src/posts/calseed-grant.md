[Perch Sensing Inc.](https://perchsensing.com) has received a $150,000 grant from the [California Sustainable Energy Entrepreneur Development Initiative (CalSEED)](https://calseed.fund/) for the development of a novel sensing platform designed to protect the grid.

With this grant, Perch Sensing Inc. can continue the development of a real-time, distributed monitoring and control system “perched” on utility infrastructure designed to help utilities predict and prevent potential utility-based ignition events, more efficiently manage power flow during shutoffs, and increase the integration of micro-grids and distributed energy storage.

Perch Sensing Inc. was among 23 other companies selected from 166 applicants to receive the concept award grant. The CalSEED grant is funded by the [California Energy Commission](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) EPIC program to advance energy innovation.

“We are honored to have received this funding opportunity which will help us further develop and showcase our technology while providing support and meaningful work to students who are not only able to learn real world applicable design engineering skills but also are able to help make our vision of protecting the grid achievable.” said Dominic Gaiero, Co-founder, Perch Sensing Inc.

The CalSEED concept award is a major milestone for Perch Sensing Inc. as it gives us the continued opportunity to conduct the research and development required to finalize a deployable prototype, which includes the need for expertise, licensing of domain-specific software, and certifications.

## About Perch Sensing Inc.

Perch Sensing Inc. is an early-stage startup focused on protecting our power grids and communities. We do this with tools that improve the visibility of previously invisible infrastructure. Perch started out as a research project at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and has since developed into a mission driven company.

The team grew up in California and witnessed first hand the devastation of wildfires, the many families displaced, communities torn apart, and lives lost. Grounded in research, we continue to build fire prediction products that help utilities and communities protect their assets and the surrounding community.

The Perch Sensing team and advisors offer an interdisciplinary background in a variety of business focusing on networking, project management, and planning; as well as technical backgrounds including computer architecture, software architecture, power systems, power electronics, mechanical engineering, renewable energy applications, reliability and security, and fault protection. We are passionate about developing new technologies to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our communities and the world today.
